#### By Dan Jacob

## Description
   Focusing on Behavior Driven Development, this application serves as a practice in specs and spec integration. Users will be able to input two words and will be directed to a page notifying them whether their words are an anagram. Users need not to worry about capitalization and spacing, as long as the characters in both forms are the same their submission will be considered an anagram referencing back end logic.
